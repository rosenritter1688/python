```git remote add origin https://github.com/rosenritter1688/python.git```
### name link as origin
```git push -u origin master```
> Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
### The -u flag is used to set origin as the upstream remote in your git config. As you push a branch successfully or up to date it, it adds upstream reference.

### As you push local branch with (the) git push -u option, that local branch is linked with the remote branch automatically. The advantage is, you may use git pull without any arguments.
